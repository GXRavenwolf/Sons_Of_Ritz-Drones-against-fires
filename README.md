# Sons_Of_Ritz-Drones against fires
We are a group of year 1 students from multiple Schools, 2 from TP, 2 from NP and 1 from ACJC. This competition was a way we found to give back to the community while also improving our coding skillset on the way as we are new to the coding scene and need the experience. Our team name is a homage to our first Computing and Programming teacher in secondary school which we always considered our coding 'father' of sorts as he never hesitated to offer us help when we needed it.

with the rising tensions around global warming and its effect on the environment due to the recent wild/forest fires in australia, our team has decided to focus on the 'Preventing The Spread'. Specifically, we are tacking the issue of wild/forest fires that many believe will never hit Singapore. To do this,we will be utilising government data sets in python scripts to predict the months of the year that are more prone to fires,drones equipped with IBM visual recognition which patrol Singapores forest to detect fires and alert the SCDF when they do, and AI(chatbot) to relay the aforementioned data to the organisations that can use it.
